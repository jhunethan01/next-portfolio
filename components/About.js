            <p>I'm a 22 year old developer living in Bristol. I discovered my passion for coding, working on a family tree application in React. I loved solving every little issue I encountered using React for the first time. Through persistence, self-discipline, and commitment, I achieved my goal of becoming a web developer. What kept me on this journey is that I always find learning new things exciting and facing unfamiliar challanges means I can grow my skills. In addition to Codeigniter, I complete side projects to keep up to date with modern coding conventions.</p>
